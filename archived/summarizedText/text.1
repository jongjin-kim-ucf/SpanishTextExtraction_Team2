Walruses are known for their distinctive appearance, which includes long tusks, whiskers, and a massive barrel-shaped body. They are found mainly in the Arctic Ocean and the subarctic seas of the Northern Hemisphere. Walruses can weigh up to 1.5 tons (3,000 pounds) or more, with males often being larger than females. Their skin is thick and wrinkled, with a layer of fat underneath to keep them warm in the cold arctic waters. A walrus' tusks can grow up to 3 feet (1 meter) long and serve multiple purposes, such as establishing dominance, breaking ice, and helping the walrus crawl onto land or ice. They have long whiskers that play a key role in searching for food on the seabed, which are very sensitive and can detect small movements. Walruses are social animals and often gather in large groups called herds, which can number hundreds or even thousands of individuals. They are well adapted for life in the Arctic, with the ability to dive deep into the ocean in search of food, which mainly consists of bivalve molluscs such as clams. Their whiskers play a crucial role in locating food on the seabed, since they are very sensitive and can detect small movements or vibrations. Walruses are found more in the Arctic Ocean and at the south pole. Walruses like to socialize animals and for groups."
